# Data Modeling with Postgres
## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. However, they currently don't have a way to query the data, which resides in a directory of **JSON logs** on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with **JSON metadata** on the songs in their app.

They need a data engineer to **create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis**. What we are going to do is to **create a database schema and ETL pipeline** for this analysis. In the final step, we'll test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare our results with their expected results.


## Project Description
In this project, we are going to **define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus**, and **write an ETL pipeline that transfers data** from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Dataset
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song](http://millionsongdataset.com/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.


```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```json
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like:

If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. For example, 
```python
df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) 
```
would read the data file `2018-11-01-events.json`.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page **NextSong**
    * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - users in the app
    * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    * song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    * artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Steps
### Files
In addition to the data files, the **project workspace** includes six files:
```
.
├── create_tables.py-----* Drops and creates tables. Run this file to reset tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
├── etl.py---------------* Reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
├── sql_queries.py-------* Contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
├── test.ipynb-----------* Displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
└── etl.ipynb------------* Reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
```

### 1. Create Tables
1. Write CREATE and DROP statements in `sql_queries.py` to create and drop each table.
1. Run `create_tables.py` to create the database and tables.
1. Run `test.ipynb` to confirm the creation of the tables with the correct columns.

### 2. Build ETL Pipeline

#### Process `song_data`
(1) `songs` Table
```python
# Extract Data for Songs Table
song_df = df[['song_id', 'title', 'artist_id', 'year', 'duration']]
song_arr = song_df.values[0]
song_data = song_arr.tolist()

# Insert Record into Songs Table
cur.execute(song_table_insert, song_data)
conn.commit()
```

(2) `artists` Table
```python
# Extract Data for Artists Table
artist_df = df[['artist_id', 'artist_name', 'artist_location', 'artist_latitude', 'artist_longitude']]
artist_arr = artist_df.values[0]
artist_data = artist_arr.tolist()

# Insert Record into Artists Table
cur.execute(artist_table_insert, artist_data)
conn.commit()
```

#### Process `log_data`
(3) `time` Table

Extract Data for Time Table

```python
# Filter records by NextSong action
df = df[df['page'].str.contains("NextSong")]

# Convert timestamp to datetime
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ts'], unit='ms')

# Create a list named time_data
time_data = [df['ts'].values, df['datetime'].dt.hour.values, df['datetime'].dt.day.values, df['datetime'].dt.week.values, df['datetime'].dt.month.values, df['datetime'].dt.year.values, df['datetime'].dt.weekday.values]

# Create time_dict
time_dict = {}
time_dict['start_time'] = time_data[0]
time_dict['hour'] = time_data[1]
time_dict['day'] = time_data[2]
time_dict['week'] = time_data[3]
time_dict['month'] = time_data[4]
time_dict['year'] = time_data[5]
time_dict['weekday'] = time_data[6]

# Convert time_dict into time_df
time_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(time_dict)
time_df.head()
```

Insert Records into Time Table
```python
for i, row in time_df.iterrows():
    cur.execute(time_table_insert, list(row))
    conn.commit()
```


(4)`users` Table

```python
# Extract Data for Users Table
user_df = df[['userId', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'gender', 'level']]

# Insert Records into Users Table
for i, row in user_df.iterrows():
    cur.execute(user_table_insert, row)
    conn.commit()
```

(5) `songplays` Table
```python
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    song_select = "SELECT songs.song_id, artists.artist_id from songs, artists where songs.artist_id = artists.artist_id"

    cur.execute(song_select)
    results = cur.fetchone()

    if results:
        songid, artistid = results
    else:
        songid, artistid = None, None
        
    songplay_data = (row.ts, row.userId, row.level, songid, artistid, row.sessionId, row.location, row.userAgent)
    
    # insert songplay record
    cur.execute(songplay_table_insert, songplay_data)
    conn.commit()
```
